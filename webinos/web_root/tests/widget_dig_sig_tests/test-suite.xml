	<test id="bad_signature" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-validation/bad_signature/bad_signature.wgt" expected="invalid">
	This test checks that a user agent rejects a broken signature block (the test has some changed bits in the signature, which makes the signature invalid). 
	To pass, the user agent must treat the signature as invalid. 
	</test>
	
	<test id="bad_hash" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-validation/bad_hash/bad_hash.wgt" expected="invalid">
	This test checks that hash checking on file references is done correctly (the test has some flipped bits in the hash of a file). 
	To pass, the user agent must reject this signature as invalid. 
	</test>
	
	<test id="changed_file" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-validation/changed_file/changed_file.wgt" expected="invalid">
	This test checks that a use agent actually does the hash checking of files (the config.xml was changed after signing). 
	To pass, the user agent must reject this widget as invalid as one of the files has been changed after signing.

	<test id="11a" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-11/11a/11a.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests that the validator treats a distributor signature without a dsp:Role
signature property as being in error. To pass the validator must fail to
validate this widget.
</test>
	<test id="11b" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-11/11b/11b.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests that the validator treats a distributor signature with a dsp:Role signature
property that does not contain a URI for a distributor role as being in error.
To pass the validator must fail to validate this widget.
</test>
	<test id="12a" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-12/12a/12a.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests that the validator treats an author signature without a dsp:Role signature

widget.

	<test id="13a" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-13/13a/13a.wgt" expected="invalid">
[Optional Test] - Tests if the validator performs revocation checking using a CRL obtained independently of the signature document. To pass the validator must fail to validate this widget as the key used to sign (revoked.13a.rsa.{key,cert}.pem) has been revoked (testCA/crl/revoked.13a.rsa.crl).

	<test id="13b" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-13/13b/13b.wgt" expected="invalid">
[Optional Test] - Tests if the validator performs revocation checking using an embedded X509CRL element. To pass the validator must fail to validate this widget as the key used to sign it (revoked.13b.rsa.{key,cert}.pem) has been revoked. 
</test>
	<test id="16c" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-16/16c/16c.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests that a widget signature contains a dsp:Profile signature properties
element with the correct URI attribute value. To pass a validator must
fail to validate this widget due to the incorrect URI in the dsp:Profile
signature property. 
</test>
	<test id="16e" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-16/16e/16e.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests that each widget signature contains a dsp:Identifier signature properties
element. To pass a validator must fail to
validate this widget as there are two dsp:Identifier elements.
</test>
	<test id="16f" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-16/16f/16f.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests if every ds:Reference used within a widget signature has a URI attribute.
To pass a validator must fail to validate this widget, as a ds:Reference is
missing a URI attribute to the LICENSE file entry.
</test>
	<test id="16g" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-16/16g/16g.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests if every ds:Reference used within a widget signature is a reference to a
file entry in the same widget package. To pass a validator must fail to validate
this widget as it references a file that is not in the widget package.
</test>
	<!--test id="20a" for="ta-generate" src="test-cases/ta-20/20a/20a.wgt">
This test is intended for products that sign widget packages. It does not apply to validators. 
Tests that the signer supports generating author and distributor signatures with the recommended signature algorithm: To run this test, generate an author signature and distributor signature with the
default RSA key ("3.rsa.key.pem") and the template files (config.xml and index.html). To pass,  
make sure the signed widget validates on at least one conforming validator. 
</test-->
	<test id="24a" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-24/24a/24a.wgt">
Tests that a validator supports the XML Canonicalization 1.0 (omits
comments) canonicalization algorithm. To pass a validator must successfully
validate this widget.
</test>
	<test id="25a" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-25/25a/25a.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests that a validator performs a case-sensitive comparisons on file
names. To pass the validator must fail to validate this widget as the reference
to the LICENSE file entry has the incorrect case.
</test>
	<test id="29a" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-29/29a/29a.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests that if an author signature is present within the widget package, the
implementation ensures that a distributor signature has a ds:Reference for any
author signature. To pass a validator must fail to validate this widget as
signature1.xml lacks a ds:Reference to author-signature.xml. 
</test>
	<test id="33a" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-33/33a/33a.wgt">
Tests that a validator is able to process a ds:Reference to same-document
XML content when that ds:Reference does not have a ds:Transform child element,
and that the default canonicalization algorithm Canonical XML 1.0 is used. To
pass the validaotr must  successfully validate this widget.
</test>
	<test id="34a" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-34/34a/34a.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests that a validator ensures that the ds:Object element contains a
single ds:SignatureProperties element. To pass a validator must fail to validate
this widget.
</test>
	<test id="35a" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-35/35a/35a.wgt">
Tests that the validator can validate a widget that makes use of various XML Digital 
Signature Properties. To pass a validator must successfully validate this widget (the user 
agent is not required to do anything with the additional properties).
</test>
	<test id="37a" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-37/37a/37a.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests if a validator ensures that the widget signature includes a
ds:Object element within the ds:Signature element. To pass a validator must fail
to validate this widget as it lacks a ds:Object element. 
</test>
	<test id="37b" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-37/37b/37b.wgt" expected="invalid">
Tests if a validator ensures that the ds:Object element is referenced by a
ds:Reference element. To pass a validator must fail to validate this widget as
it lacks a ds:Reference to the ds:Object element. 
</test>

	<test id="40a" for="ta-validate" src="test-cases/ta-40/40a/40a.wgt">
Tests whether the validator can locate all signature files in a widget package.
To pass the validator must find "signature1.xml", "signature2.xml",
"signature987654321.xml" and "author-signature.xml".
