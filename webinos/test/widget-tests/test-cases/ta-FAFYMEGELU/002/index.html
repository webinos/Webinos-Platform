Tests the UA's ability to locate an icon in a locale folder and at the root of the widget. 
To pass, after processing, the icons list must contain a pointer to "locales/en/icon.png", and "icon.png", which is at the root of the widget. 
The icons list needs to be in the correct order, where "locales/en/icon.png" must be first and "icon.png" must be second.</p>
