DESCRIPTION

A set of APIs that enable device and service discovery, connection over multiple discovery protocols.

The purpose of the Local Connection Manager is to provide a generic interface that isolate differences of 
the low level discovery schemes. 

Users for this interface are application developers and webinos core platform developers.

	examples are coming soon!
 
[2] Webinos core developers and users for PZP peer discovery.

	Enrol at least of two of your PZPs with PZH. Make sure they are connected while in Hub mode.
	Stop Hub.
	
	Restart the two PZPs. They should discover each other and get connected automatically.
